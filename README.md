# Kan-ban board

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool used to track work, optimize efficiency, and improve workflow by displaying tasks as cards moving across columns (typically "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done"). It helps teams visualize bottlenecks, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and enhance transparency.

## Motive

I made this project for learning purpose, so right now i only plan to implement localstorage but may be some day i will implement actual database system.

## Work is still in progress

Currently working on Drag and drop feature
