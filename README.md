# Kan-ban board

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool used to track work, optimize efficiency, and improve workflow by displaying tasks as cards moving across columns (typically "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done"). It helps teams visualize bottlenecks, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and enhance transparency.
